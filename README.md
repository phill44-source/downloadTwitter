# downloadTwitter
Automatically download photos from a (list of) user, or fetch the video links in the tweets.

## Requirements
You must have python installed. You can follow the instructions and download python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Any version of python can work with this library, but I recommend Python 2.7.9 (or greater), or Python 3.4 (or greater) because they come with `pip` installed by default.    
Once you have python (and pip) downloaded, you can run these commands in your Command Prompt (or Terminal)  
`pip install tweepy`    

`pip install wget`

## How to run
Fill in your credentials, and other parameters in the `input_data.py` file.  
In your Command Prompt (or Terminal), you can automatically download pictures / fetch video urls from specified users as follows:  
`python twitter_download.py`
